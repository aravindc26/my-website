Velu is an AI assistant engineered for technical documentation teams. It accelerates how knowledge is captured and maintained so writers can keep product docs current without the heavy lift of manual updates.

## Why Velu
- **Teams ship faster.** Technical writers, product managers, and engineers collaborate with Velu to draft, review, and ship updates in a fraction of the usual time.
- **Quality stays high.** Language models tuned for technical content help reinforce accuracy, consistency, and style compliance across every page.

## How Velu Works
Velu ingests trusted sources across your organization, including:
- Internal Google Drive folders and shared drives
- Project management tools (epics, tickets, release plans)
- Team communication platforms (FAQs, stakeholder decisions)
- Customer support software (ticketing systems, helpdesk transcripts)
- Knowledge bases such as Confluence and similar repositories

By consolidating that context, Velu can surface the right information while drafting, flag stale content, and recommend edits that align with current requirements.

## Who Velu Empowers
| Persona | What They Gain |
| --- | --- |
| Technical writers | Assisted drafting, context-aware updates, and instant suggestions for style alignment |
| Product managers | Confidence that launch-critical documentation matches product reality |
| Engineers | Streamlined review cycles and fewer documentation bottlenecks |

## Outcomes You Can Expect

- **High-quality content:** Maintain consistent tone, terminology, and technical depth across documentation libraries.
